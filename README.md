# washinvestments

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of washinvestments is to provide users documentation on the
data set published alongside the article “Multilateral development banks
investment behaviour in water and sanitation: Findings and lessons from
60 years of investment projects in Africa and Asia” (Heidler et al.
2023).

## Installation

You can install the development version of washinvestments from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("openwashdata/washinvestments")
```

Alternatively, you can download the dataset as a CSV or XLSX file from
the table below.

## Project goal

Multilateral development banks (MDBs) significantly influence water and
sanitation infrastructure development. However, data on their
investments is dispersed and hard to compare. This project presents a
new data set compiled by drawing on 3,639 water and sanitation projects
that aims at assessing “territorial trends, technology choices,
distribution of financial burdens, and reforms to institutional
arrangements to analyze the investment behaviour of the World Bank, ADB,
and AfDB in water supply and sanitation from their first operations in
the 1960s until 2020 and distil how they responded to trends in
urbanization and the policy debates about governing access to basic
services.” (Heidler et al. 2023)

## Data

The data set includes information about water and sanitation projects
conducted in Africa and Asia between 1960 and 2020. The package provides
access to one data set.

``` r
library(washinvestments)
```

The `washinvestments` data set has 52 variables and 1873 observations.
For an overview of the variable names, see the following table.

## Example: Investment trends in Africa and Asia over 60 years

Here is a basic example demonstrating how to address a common problem:
analyzing the evolution of financing in the WASH sector over 60 years.
We focus on the continents mentioned in the paper: Africa and Asia. The
first plot below illustrates the number of investment projects financed
in the WASH sector from 1960 to 2020. It is evident that a higher number
of projects in Asia have secured financing. Furthermore, there is a
noticeable upward trend in the number of investment projects over the
years, reaching its peak in 2009. In a second place, we display the
investment trends in Asia over 60 years, focusing on different regions
within the continent. The third plot displays the investment trends in
Africa over 60 years, focusing on different regions within the
continent.
