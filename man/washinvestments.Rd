\item{ppp_sanitation}{The form of the public private partnership (PPP) or private sector participation (PSP) arrangement promoted or implemented. For the distribution of ownership, risks and revenues between public and private actors, refer to Budds & McGranahan (2003). For details on the different PPP categories refer to World Bank (2017): Promotion = Either PPPs or PSP are generally promoted, capacity building or institutional reforms explicitly aim to facilitate PPPs or PSP. But no execution of a specific arrangement is planned under the project, Construction = PPP arrangements focusing solely on design, engineering and construction of infrastructure, Service-O&M = PPP arrangements for service delivery and/or O&M without any ownership of infrastructure asset, Lease-Affermage = The infrastructure is leased to a private actor for a distinct period. The government typically remains responsible for capital expenditures, BOT-type = A private actor builds, operates, and then transfers the infra-structure back to a public actor, Concession = A private actor buys the right to invest in a particular sector for a particular time, Divestiture = Assets and the right to pursue business in a basic service are sold to a private entity}

\item{amount_water}{The total amount allocated for water supply related project components: Values = Amounts in original currency, N/A = sector does not include water supply, NED = available documents did not allow to differentiate between water and other investments}
\item{primary_c}{Number of primary cities targeted in a project: Numbers = the number of primary cities targeted in a project, MULTI = An uncountable number of primary cities are addressed under the project. This is mainly true for regional or national projects that do not explicitly mention all cities.}

\item{ur5}{Indicates whether institutional reforms aim to ‘go to the market’ through pursuing specific PPP arrangements are financed under the investment project: TRUE = reforms to increase private partnerships are financed, FALSE = no reforms to increase private partnerships are financed}
\item{er1}{Indicates whether institutional reforms address authorities to improve the enabling environment for non-sewered sanitation and the sanitation economy. The variables ER1-ER3 are based on the suggestions of WSUP (2020) and IWA (2021) for reforming the sanitation sector to scale non-sewered infrastructures: TRUE = reforms to create an enabling regulatory environment are financed, FALSE = no reforms to create an enabling regulatory environment are financed}
\item{er2}{Indicates whether institutional reforms address private sector service providers and aim to incentivise them to enter the sanitation economy or regulate their activities: TRUE = reforms to regulate sanitation service providers are financed, FALSE = no reforms to regulate sanitation service providers are financed, NA = for all entries that were not coded under Subset 3}
