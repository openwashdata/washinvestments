# washinvestments

The goal of washinvestments is to provide users documentation on the data set published alongside the article "Multilateral
development banks investment behaviour in water and sanitation: Findings
and lessons from 60 years of investment projects in Africa and Asia"
[@heidler2023multilateral].

## Installation

You can install the development version of washinvestments from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("openwashdata/washinvestments")
```

Alternatively, you can download the dataset as a CSV or XLSX file from
the table below.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

extdata_path <- "https://github.com/openwashdata/washinvestments/raw/main/inst/extdata/"

read_csv("data-raw/dictionary.csv") |> 
  distinct(file_name) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(file_name = str_remove(file_name, ".rda")) |> 
  dplyr::rename(dataset = file_name) |> 
  mutate(
    CSV = paste0("[Download CSV](", extdata_path, dataset, ".csv)"),
    XLSX = paste0("[Download XLSX](", extdata_path, dataset, ".xlsx)")
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()

```

## Project goal

Multilateral development banks (MDBs) significantly influence water and
sanitation infrastructure development. However, data on their investments is
dispersed and hard to compare. This project presents a new data set
compiled by drawing on 3,639 water and sanitation projects that aims at
assessing "territorial trends, technology choices, distribution of
financial burdens, and reforms to institutional arrangements to analyze
the investment behaviour of the World Bank, ADB, and AfDB in water
supply and sanitation from their first operations in the 1960s until
2020 and distil how they responded to trends in urbanization and the
policy debates about governing access to basic services."
[@heidler2023multilateral]

## Data

The data set includes information about water and sanitation projects
conducted in Africa and Asia between 1960 and 2020. The package provides
access to one data set.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(washinvestments)
```

The `washinvestments` data set has `r ncol(washinvestments)` variables
and `r nrow(washinvestments)` observations. For an overview of the
variable names, see the following table.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
washinvestments
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
readr::read_csv("data-raw/dictionary.csv") |> 
  dplyr::filter(file_name == "washinvestments.rda") |> 
  dplyr::select(variable_name:description) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Example: Investment trends in Africa and Asia over 60 years

Here is a basic example illustrating the analysis of financing trends in the WASH sector over 60 years, with a focus on Africa and Asia as outlined in the paper. The first plot displays the aggregated number of investment projects in the WASH sector from 1960 to 2020, grouped in 10-year intervals. It is notable that a higher number of projects in Asia have secured financing, with a significant increase observed since around the 2000s. Moreover, there is a discernible upward trend in the number of investment projects over the years. Subsequently, we explore investment trends within Asia and Africa separately. The second plot illustrates investment patterns in Asia, examining various regions within the continent. Likewise, the third plot focuses on investment trends in Africa, with a breakdown by different regions.
